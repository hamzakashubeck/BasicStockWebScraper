# BasicStockWebScraper

A basic web scraper that prompts the user for a ticker symbol, and returns current information about the stock sourced from Yahoo Finance and Robinhood. The purpose of this project is to learn and practice basic web scraping, NOT to quickly retrieve stock data (an API would be more effective for that).
